# BrachyNextGen
Code and data for the article titled "More fungi than legs: the first fungal microbiome for a fungus-eating millipede (Colobognatha)".

This repository contains 5 files:

1) An Excel file with the ten supplemental tables from the article above.
2) A .yml file that allows you to create the amptk conda environment I set up for my analysis.
3) A .yml file that allows you to create the BASTA conda environment I set up for my analysis.
4) Code for analysing raw Illumina data, up through import into R for further analysis.
5) Code for analysing the output of #4 above in R, including figures.

Notes for each of the above:
1) See publication 
2) You must update the prefix at the end of the file with your preferred path. For help installing or running AMPtk, see https://amptk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and for information on conda environments and YML/YAML files, see https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html
